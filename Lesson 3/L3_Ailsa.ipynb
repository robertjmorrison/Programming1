    "In the UK, employers must ensure that office spaces are no colder than 16 degrees (C). A program has been developed to determine if office temperature is too cold, but the thermometer the system is connected to uses Fahrenheit - the American system. Fahrenheit values are larger than Celsius, so even if the user inputs 50F (quite cold, equal to 10C) the system will still say it is more than 16 so there is no problem. There is no easy way to change this. You should write a function to convert the inputted Fahrenheit value to Celsius. You will need to research the formula for this. "
